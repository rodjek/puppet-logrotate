# Logrotate module for Puppet

## Disclaimer 

This module is a fork of https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-logrotate merging some of the outstanding pull requests

## Description  

A more Puppety way of managing logrotate configs.  Where possible, as many of
the configuration options have remained the same with a couple of notable
exceptions:

 * Booleans are now used instead of the `<something>`/`no<something>` pattern.
   e.g. `copy` == `copy => true`, `nocopy` == `copy => false`.
 * `create` and it's three optional arguments have been split into seperate
   parameters documented below.
 * Instead of 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly' or 'yearly', there is a
   `rotate_every` parameter (see documentation below).

## logrotate::conf

You may, optionally, define logrotate defaults using this defined type.
Parameters are the same as those for logrotate::rule.
Using this type will automatically include a private class that will install
and configure logrotate for you.

## logrotate::rule

The only thing you'll need to deal with, this type configures a logrotate rule.
Using this type will automatically include a private class that will install
and configure logrotate for you.

```
namevar         - The String name of the rule.
path            - The path String to the logfile(s) to be rotated.
ensure          - The desired state of the logrotate rule as a String.  Valid
                  values are 'absent' and 'present' (default: 'present').
compress        - A Boolean value specifying whether the rotated logs should
                  be compressed (optional).
compresscmd     - The command String that should be executed to compress the
                  rotated logs (optional).
compressext     - The extention String to be appended to the rotated log files
                  after they have been compressed (optional).
compressoptions - A String of command line options to be passed to the
                  compression program specified in `compresscmd` (optional).

                  copy of the log file and not touch the original (optional).

                  log file immediately after rotation (optional).

                  created log file if create => true (optional).
create_owner    - A username String that logrotate should set the owner of the
                  newly created log file to if create => true (optional).

                  created log file if create => true (optional).
dateext         - A Boolean specifying whether rotated log files should be
                  archived by adding a date extension rather just a number
                  (optional).

                  after rotation (optional).

                  rotated out of existence are emailed to (optional).
mailfirst       - A Boolean that when used with `mail` has logrotate email the

                  (optional).
maillast        - A Boolean that when used with `mail` has logrotate email the

                  can stay on the system (optional).
